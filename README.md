# voter_gab

<b>A website built in Javascript/MEAN.</b>

Provides the voting public a tool to get informed and share endorsements of ballot measures.  Users can create groups, and add members to their group, and then collectively vote on endorsements.  Data is pulled from public APIs for ballot information.  Each group has its own live chat, where users can weigh in on the endorsement vote.
